The Mysore Dasara festival is a ten-day celebration in Mysore, India, and the highlight is definitely the illumination of the Mysore Palace.  During this time, the palace is adorned with nearly 100,000 light bulbs, making it a truly dazzling spectacle. 

In addition to the Mysore Palace, the entire city of Mysore is lit up with festive lights during Dasara.  Streets, buildings, and circles are all illuminated, creating a magical atmosphere.  The lighting displays are not just random collections of lights - they often depict scenes from mythology or nature.
