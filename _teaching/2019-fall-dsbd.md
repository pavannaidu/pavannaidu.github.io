Organizations and businesses need data driven actionable insights. For example, a casino may want to identify whether there is a certain group of customers from which more business occurs—a task known as customer segmentation. A cell phone company may want to know if there is a risk of customers leaving for another carrier—a business situation known as customer churn. Analytic tasks that facilitate such actionable insights include prediction, optimization, recommendation, classification, clustering etc.

Learning Objectives:
* Appreciate the value of data as a strategic resource for organizations
* Understand core analytics tasks e.g., exploratory data analysis, classification, prediction,
optimization, recommendation etc.
* Hands on experience with data science tools and real-world case studies
* Exposure to the nature, potential, and tools for processing Big Data
